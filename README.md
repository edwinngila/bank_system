## <u>Interfaces & Abstract</u>
### interfaces 
<p>
   In kotlin interfaces are used to define methods that a class will implement. 
   The methods that are created can only be extended to other classes that what to implement them.
   in the real-world, interfaces are considered to be a blueprint drown out by architects or 
   contract written by a people in agreement.

### Abstract
<p>
   Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
   A real-world explanation for Abstraction is a car, where the engin of a car is hidden under the hood of the car living the 
   steer wheel,gear shift and peddles for the driver
